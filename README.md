# CircularSlider
Circular slider and partial arc sliders for iOS in Swift.

This code is based on [EFCircularSlider](https://github.com/eliotfowler/EFCircularSlider) by Eliot Fowler with some significant changes:
* All code has been converted to Swift
* This library supports multiple types of sliders
  * double-handled sliders
  * partial arc (incomplete circle) sliders
  * sliders with a gradient background
  
## Examples
The Xcode project in the `CirclularSliderExample/` directory contains examples of to to create various types of sliders (WIP). 

## Installation
Copy the class files in the `CircularSlider/` directory into your Xcode project.

I hope to add support for dependecy managers in the future.
